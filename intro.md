####Geekwise Academy Cohort #2

**Intros**

Lets get to know each other.

**Expectations**

This program is desiged to help nurture the development of our local software developers by giving them a place where they can learn, work on real client work, and get paid to do so.  It's a direct investment in the future of our local tech economy.  If you're chosen to participate in the program, you should treat it as such.  It's a direct investment in you. 

* Cohort runs 9-5, Monday - Friday
* Being late / absent is not ok without some kind of prior notice.  (I'm not unresonable, come talk to me if something comes up)
* We will follow some pretty specific development guidelines that everyone will be expected to participate in.
* We expect your best effort, always.

**Work Hours**

But for reals, this profession in general can require long hours of staring at your computer screen.  If this is something that doesn't work for you, then we might have a problem.  Our general work hours are 9-5, but that doesn't mean that the work day ends there if you have a deadline "tomorrow" and still have 10 hours of work to comlete.
