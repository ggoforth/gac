###Geekwise Academy Cohort #2

**Intros**

Lets get to know each other.

I'd like to know:

* Who are you?
* Why are you here?
* Relevant development experience?

**Expectations**

This program is desiged to help nurture the development of our local software developers by giving them a place where they can learn, work on real client work, and get paid to do so.  It's a direct investment in the future of our local tech economy.  If you're chosen to participate in the program, you should treat it as such.  It's a direct investment in you. 

* Cohort runs 9-5, Monday - Friday
* Being late / absent is not ok without some kind of prior notice.  (I'm not unresonable, come talk to me if something comes up)
* We will follow some pretty specific development guidelines that everyone will be expected to participate in.
* We expect your best effort, always.
* All cohorters will be expected to co-teach some geekwise classes.  This typically looks like an alternating schedule of on for 6 weeks, off for 6 weeks.  More on this to follow.

**Something New**

We may be trying someting new, the details of which are still up in the air.  We are looking to expand cohort to include more than 8 people.  In order to do so we must somehow figure out how to do that, and the following is one idea being kicked around:

* Take up to 16 individuals into cohort.
    * 8 for cohort proper
    * 8 for cohort plus
* Cohort proper operates just as the previous one did.  A rate of $2000 a month for the next six months.
* Cohort plus is a eat what you kill type of program.  The more work you complete, the more projects you finish, the more you can make.  There is no set limit as to how much you can make in this program.  You will still have the guidance of a cohort director and access to all the things that a normal cohort member would have.  You will be paid half up front for every project, and half upon completion. 

**Work Hours**

12am / 12am Mon-Sun

I kid, but not really.  Software development is typically not a carear path one
chooses if they are interested in a simple 9-5.  The way you win more projects /
clients is by ensuring that you meet deadlines and deliver a quality product.
This often means choosing to stay up into the wee hours of the morning to make
sure your projects get done.  This was certainly true for me, and of most
developers that I know.  This is all to say...

**Projects**

Project's will vary, as will the clients and the technology we use to solve problems.  This round, we've selected the MEAN Stack as our primary weapon of choice, but we'll likely utilize other tech (PHP, vagrant / virtual box, WordPress, etc...) to tackle specific parts of a project.  For instance, many web applications we would be building also require a front end website (for marketing purposes) so we'll be working to put those together too.  

While you will have a cohort director to oversee your projects, one thing should be very clear.  **You are responsible for your projects.  You are resonsible for understanding the project needs, identifying area's of uncertainty to discuss with your director, and commnicating with your clients on a regular interval.**  We want to give you 3-5 years worth of "freelance" experience over the next 6 months, and to do that we need you 100% invested in your given projects.

**MEAN Stack**

We want cohort participants (cohorters) to be able to focus their efforts on one tech stack.  We would rather have you really good at one thing, than sorta good at 3.  With that in mind we're going to focus on MEAN stack this round.  This means we're looking at a 100% javascript application environment.  This is actually really fun to work with, and is nice not having to switch back and forth between languages when writing more complicated applications.

* MEAN
    * [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.org/) (The database)
    * [Express](http://expressjs.com/) (The application backend)
    * [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) (The application frontend)
    * [Node](https://nodejs.org) (What the application backend runs on)
* Full javascript environment
* Utilizing modern build tools (gulp, less / sass)

**Tools of the Trade**

Before we jump in and start coding anything, lets talk about development environments.  By development environments, I'm talking about your host operating system and the tools you use.  This combination makes up your development environment.  Most developers are pretty picky when it comes to the IDE they use, which text editor is their favorite, etc...so it's good to start forming some opinions now.  

The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) / text editor you choose is up to you.  I have very specific things that I like in my IDE's so most everything I demo for you will be done in those editors.  I typically use:

* [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - A fantastic, super feature rich IDE.  This is my daily driver for project work.
* [vim](http://www.vim.org/) - A terminal text editor. Great for quick edits from a terminal (or when logged into a remote web server).
* [iterm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/) - A great terminal, gets daily use.  Used for running build tools (gulp / grunt), managing files, etc...
* [jsbin](http://jsbin.com) - Defacto REPL for testing js / html / css ideas.
* [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop) - Invaluable tool for testing application routes / endpoints.
* [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) - And more specifically the chrome developer tools.  Javascript can sometimes be tricky to debug, and the developer tools help greatly to identify issues.

I mentioned iterm 2 above, and I'll need for you to pretty quickly identify the terminal you will be using for your own development tasks.  Use whatever you find that you like, but below is a list of terminals I've come into contact with that will get the job done.

* OSX / iTerm
* Linux / Built in shell is totally suitable
* Windows / git bash - cygwin - cmder

Note: The built in windows terminal is insufficient for our needs so you'll need to find an alternative.  Git bash will come when you install git on your machine.  Many of the previous cohort memebers that developed on windows liked [cmder](http://gooseberrycreative.com/cmder/).  I've not used cygwin, but it's another option.


**Version Control**

We'll be using git, with github.com being the central home for our repositories.  We'll focus on a "gitflow" style of development.  We'll talk more about git flow soon, but for now, [go read this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows).
