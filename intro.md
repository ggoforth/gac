###Geekwise Academy Cohort #2

**Intros**

Lets get to know each other.

**Expectations**

This program is desiged to help nurture the development of our local software developers by giving them a place where they can learn, work on real client work, and get paid to do so.  It's a direct investment in the future of our local tech economy.  If you're chosen to participate in the program, you should treat it as such.  It's a direct investment in you. 

* Cohort runs 9-5, Monday - Friday
* Being late / absent is not ok without some kind of prior notice.  (I'm not unresonable, come talk to me if something comes up)
* We will follow some pretty specific development guidelines that everyone will be expected to participate in.
* We expect your best effort, always.
* All cohorters will be expected to co-teach some geekwise classes.  This typically looks like an alternating schedule of on for 6 weeks, off for 6 weeks.  More on this to follow.

**Something New**

We may be trying someting new, the details of which are still up in the air.  We are looking to expand cohort to include more than 8 people.  In order to do so we must somehow figure out how to do that, and the following is one idea being kicked around:

* Take up to 16 individuals into cohort.
    * 8 for cohort proper
    * 8 for cohort plus
* Cohort proper operates just as the previous one did.  A rate of $2000 a month for the next six months.
* Cohort plus is a eat what you kill type of program.  The more work you complete, the more projects you finish, the more you can make.  There is no set limit as to how much you can make in this program.  You will still have the guidance of a cohort director and access to all the things that a normal cohort member would have.  You will be paid half up front for every project, and half upon completion. 

**Work Hours**

But for reals, this profession in general can require long hours of staring at your computer screen.  If this is something that doesn't work for you, then we might have a problem.  Our general work hours are 9-5, but that doesn't mean that the work day ends there if you have a deadline "tomorrow" and still have 10 hours of work to comlete.  It will often be the case that you'll need to choose between turning in early and meeting a deadline.  

**Projects**

Project's will vary, as will the clients and the technology we use to solve problems.  This round, we've selected the MEAN Stack as our primary weapon of choice, but we'll likely utilize other tech (PHP, vagrant / virtual box, WordPress, etc...) to tackle specific parts of a project.  For instance, many web applications we would be building also requrie a front end website (for marketing purposes) so we'll be working to put those together too.
