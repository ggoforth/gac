###Geekwise Academy Cohort #2

**Intros**

Lets get to know each other.

**Expectations**

This program is desiged to help nurture the development of our local software developers by giving them a place where they can learn, work on real client work, and get paid to do so.  It's a direct investment in the future of our local tech economy.  If you're chosen to participate in the program, you should treat it as such.  It's a direct investment in you. 

* Cohort runs 9-5, Monday - Friday
* Being late / absent is not ok without some kind of prior notice.  (I'm not unresonable, come talk to me if something comes up)
* We will follow some pretty specific development guidelines that everyone will be expected to participate in.
* We expect your best effort, always.
* All cohorters will be expected to co-teach some geekwise classes.  This typically looks like an alternating schedule of on for 6 weeks, off for 6 weeks.  More on this to follow.

**Something New**

We may be trying someting new, the details of which are still up in the air.  We are looking to expand cohort to include more than 8 people.  In order to do so we must somehow figure out how to do that, and the following is one idea being kicked around:

* Take up to 16 individuals into cohort.
    * 8 for cohort proper
    * 8 for cohort plus
* Cohort proper operates just as the previous one did.  A rate of $2000 a month for the next six months.
* Cohort plus is a eat what you kill type of program.  The more work you complete, the more projects you finish, the more you can make.  There is no set limit as to how much you can make in this program.  You will still have the guidance of a cohort director and access to all the things that a normal cohort member would have.  You will be paid half up front for every project, and half upon completion. 

**Work Hours**

![Brace Yourselves](https://i.imgflip.com/ntbsy.jpg)

But for reals, this profession in general can require long hours of staring at your computer screen.  If this is something that doesn't work for you, then we might have a problem.  Our general work hours are 9-5, but that doesn't mean that the work day ends there if you have a deadline "tomorrow" and still have 10 hours of work to comlete.  It will often be the case that you'll need to choose between turning in early and meeting a deadline.  

**Projects**

Project's will vary, as will the clients and the technology we use to solve problems.  This round, we've selected the MEAN Stack as our primary weapon of choice, but we'll likely utilize other tech (PHP, vagrant / virtual box, WordPress, etc...) to tackle specific parts of a project.  For instance, many web applications we would be building also require a front end website (for marketing purposes) so we'll be working to put those together too.  

While you will have a cohort director to oversee your projects, one thing should be very clear.  __**You are responsible for your projects.  You are resonsible for understanding the project needs, identifying area's of uncertainty to discuss with your director, and commnicating with your clients on a regular interval.**__  We want to give you 3-5 years worth of "freelance" experience over the next 6 months, and to do that we need you 100% invested in your given projects.

**MEAN Stack**

We want cohort participants (cohorters) to be able to focus their efforts on one tech stack.  We would rather have you really good at one thing, than sorta good at 3.  With that in mind we're going to focus on MEAN stack this round.  This means we're looking at a 100% javascript application environment.  This is actually really fun to work with, and is nice not having to switch back and forth between languages when writing more complicated applications.

* MEAN
    * Mongo (The database)
    * Express (The application backend)
    * Angular (The application frontend)
    * Node (What the application backend runs on)
* Full javascript environment
* Utilizing modern build tools (gulp, less / sass)

**Tools of the Trade**

Before we get started with JS 101, lets talk about our development environments.  Who's on windows?  Who's on Mac?  Anyone on linux?  The development environments for every system is different, but the vast majority of servers you'll end up working on will be Linux based.  The terminal will become very familar to everyone over the next 6 months.  Given this, I want everyone to identify the terminal application you'll be using.  

* OSX / iTerm
* Linux / Built in shell is totally suitable
* Windows / git bash - cygwin - cmder

The built in windows terminal is insufficient for our needs so you'll need to find an alternative.  Git bash will come when you install git on your machine.  Many of the previous cohort memebers that developed on windows liked [cmder](http://gooseberrycreative.com/cmder/).  I've not used cygwin, but it's another option.

The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) / text editor you choose is up to you.  I have very specific things that I like in my IDE's so most everything I demo for you will be done in those editors.  I typically use:

* [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - A fantastic, super feature rich IDE.  This is my daily driver for project work.
* [vim](http://www.vim.org/) - A terminal text editor. Great for quick edits from a terminal (or when logged into a remote web server).
* [iterm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/) - A great terminal, gets daily use.  Used for running build tools (gulp / grunt), managing files, etc...
* [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop) - Invaluable tool for testing application routes / endpoints.
* [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) - And more specifically the chrome developer tools.  Javascript can sometimes be tricky to debug, and the developer tools help greatly to identify issues.
